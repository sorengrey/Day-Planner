<br>

This application is meant to help the user stay organized during their workday. The timeblocks allow the user to schedule and save tasks that will remain even if the page is refreshed or the window is closed. It displays the current day of the week and the day's date above the timeblocks, using Moment.js.

The timeblocks are color-coded to help the user see which tasks are in the past (gray), which tasks are happening within the current hour (red), and which tasks are in the future (green). I used Moment.js to import the current time, which I saved as a variable and then formatted.

Bootstrap was implemented to build the grid for the timeblocks, and FontAwesome was used to add an icon to the save buttons.
